# Archon 72

Constitutional AI Governance System with 72 Agents

## Overview

Archon 72 is a witnessed, transparent, and accountable AI governance system built on constitutional principles. It features:

- **72 Concurrent Agents** - Multi-agent deliberation and collective decision-making
- **Cryptographic Witnessing** - All actions are signed and verifiable
- **Halt-Over-Degrade Philosophy** - System integrity takes precedence over availability
- **Append-Only Event Store** - Immutable audit trail with hash-chaining

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
poetry install

# Run smoke tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_smoke.py -v

# Start development environment (requires Docker)
make dev
```

## Architecture

The system follows hexagonal architecture:

```
src/
├── domain/           # Pure business logic, NO infrastructure imports
├── application/      # Use cases, orchestration, ports
├── infrastructure/   # Adapters (Supabase, Redis, HSM)
└── api/              # FastAPI routes, DTOs
```

## Constitutional Truths

| ID | Truth |
|----|-------|
| CT-11 | Silent failure destroys legitimacy |
| CT-12 | Witnessing creates accountability |
| CT-13 | Integrity outranks availability |
| CT-14 | Complexity is constitutional debt |
