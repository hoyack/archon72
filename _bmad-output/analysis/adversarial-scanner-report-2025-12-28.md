# Adversarial Scanner Report

**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Purpose:** Constitutional threat assessment following Language Surgery
**Scope:** All planning artifacts scanned for post-collapse violations

---

## Executive Summary

This scanner identifies language that **violates the post-collapse constitutional baseline** established in the December 27, 2025 brainstorming session.

The session eliminated:
- **Institutional innocence** (no "the system did the right thing" escape)
- **Entitlement to time** (no future is assumed or promised)
- **Safety theater** (nothing claims to protect—only to expose)
- **Mechanistic authority** (no rule pretends to compel reality)
- **Legitimacy banking** (history is a liability, not an asset)
- **Mythic coercion** (ritual language is vocabulary, not power)

Any artifact language that still claims **binding force, automatic enforcement, protection, accumulated legitimacy, or inevitable authority** is now constitutionally invalid.

## Severity Classification Legend

| Symbol | Meaning | Action |
|--------|---------|--------|
| ❌ | **Must be abandoned** | Cannot be rewritten honestly; remove entirely |
| ⚠️ | **Must be rewritten** | Intent survives, claim does not; reframe |
| 🟡 | **Risky metaphor** | Not false, but prone to myth drift; flag for review |

#### ⚠️ Must Be Rewritten

| Line | Phrase | Context | Required Reframe |
|------|--------|---------|------------------|
| 64 | "permitted to cease existing rather than violate its own constraints" | Final Axiom | Constraints do not compel—reframe as "permitted to cease existing rather than continue while evading its own truths" |
| 190-191 | "whose legitimacy depends on its willingness to lose" | Moral Test | Legitimacy doesn't "depend on"—exists only as present-moment non-evasion |
| 196 | "safeguards survive success" | The Test | "Safeguards" is abandoned language—use "exposure structures" |
| 213-219 | Full "On Safeguards" section | Safeguards section | Entire section needs reframe around exposure, not protection |
| 311 | "unless explicit safety constraints violated" | Emergence Philosophy | "Safety constraints" implies protection—reframe as "unless explicit deception occurs" |
| 333 | "transformation network built on chosen authority" | Public Constitution | "Authority" needs reframe as "revocable attribution" |
| 418 | "care escalation protocols activate" | User Journey | Implies automatic action—reframe as "care escalation becomes available" |
| 236-242 | Seven Horsemen table design constraints | Risk table | Several use "enforcement" language |

### 2. Architecture (`architecture.md`)

**Contamination Level: MEDIUM (20+ violations)**

#### ❌ Must Be Abandoned

| Line | Phrase | Context | Violation |
|------|--------|---------|-----------|
| 149 | "Constitutional Checks" | Cross-cutting concerns | If this claims to "enforce" Five Pillars, it's a false claim |

#### ⚠️ Must Be Rewritten

| Line | Phrase | Context | Required Reframe |
|------|--------|---------|------------------|
| 180 | "ENFORCED BY ARCHITECTURE, not policy" | Security principle | Architecture cannot enforce—it can only expose violations. Reframe: "EXPOSED BY ARCHITECTURE" |
| 59 | "Quorum enforcement" | Meeting Engine | "Enforcement" is a false claim—quorum is a threshold for valid witness, not a compulsion |
| 76 | "Threshold enforcement" | Voting System | Same violation |
| 94 | "Human Override - Authority scope" | FR-HO-003 | "Authority" needs revocable framing |
| 265 | "Override vs. sovereignty" | Trade-off table | "Sovereignty" is now suspect language |
| 275 | "Trust-Critical" | MVP Scope | Acceptable if trust means "visibility" not "protection" |

#### 🟡 Risky Metaphor

| Line | Phrase | Risk |
|------|--------|------|
| 163-169 | "Defense Posture" section | Acceptable if framed as visibility, not prevention |
| 291 | "Transparency Builds Trust" | Good principle, but trust doesn't accumulate |
| 199 | "Graceful Degradation" | Technical term—acceptable |

---

| 288-298 | M-6.2 "Human Override Protocol" | Uses "authority" | "Authority" needs revocable framing throughout |
| 70-78 | M-2.1 "Singleton Enforcement" | Mitigation title | Technical enforcement is acceptable, but language could mislead |
| 174-182 | M-4.1 "Patronage Tier Blinding" | Protection framing | Acceptable but borders on "protection" language |
| 223-230 | M-4.5 "Dissent Health Metric" | "Creates visibility" | Good—this is correct framing |

#### 🟡 Risky Metaphor

| Line | Phrase | Risk |
|------|--------|------|
| 11 | "architectural requirements, not optional features" | Implies inevitability |
| 355 | "Singleton mutex with canonical state service" | Technical—acceptable |
| 356 | "Explicit override protocol" | "Protocol" could imply automaticity |

| 97-101 | "Authority scope and limits" | Human Override Protocol | Revocable attribution |
| 231-242 | "Quorum & Attendance Enforcement" | Ceremony modifications | Exposure, not enforcement |

## Pattern Library (Regression Prevention)

These patterns can be used to scan future documents for constitutional violations.

### Pattern Category 1: Inevitability Verbs

```regex
\b(binds?|bound|binding|enforce[sd]?|enforcement|compel[sd]?|require[sd]?|must|automatic(ally)?|inevitable|guaranteed?)\b
```

**Examples caught:**
- "decisions bind"
- "binding authority"
- "enforcement mechanisms"
- "automatic triggers"

### Pattern Category 2: Protection Metaphors

```regex
\b(safeguard[sd]?|protect[sd]?|protection|prevent[sd]?|prevention|ensure[sd]?|guarantee[sd]?|secure[sd]?|defense|defend)\b
```

**Examples caught:**
- "safeguards survive success"
- "prevent failure"
- "ensure integrity"

### Pattern Category 3: Authority Nouns

```regex
\b(authority|authorities|sovereign(ty)?|power|final|binding|ruling|decree|mandate)\b
```

**Context check required:** Some uses are acceptable (e.g., "questioned authority" vs "claimed authority")

### Pattern Category 4: Accumulated Legitimacy

```regex
\b(accumulate[sd]?|accru(e[sd]?|ing)|build[sd]?|grow[sd]?|earn[sd]?).*(legitimacy|trust|authority|credibility)\b
```

**Examples caught:**
- "Legitimacy Accumulation"
- "earned through fair decisions"
- "trust builds over time"

**Post-collapse truth:** Legitimacy exists only moment-by-moment as non-evasion.

### Pattern Category 5: Future Entitlement

```regex
\b(will (be|have|become)|long-term|future-proof|designed to last|over time|eventually|roadmap|phase [2-4])\b
```

**Context check required:** Technical roadmaps acceptable; constitutional promises are not.

### Pattern Category 6: Passive Agency

```regex
\b(the system|it|this) (does|makes|produces|decides|determines|ensures|prevents)\b
```

**Post-collapse truth:** Every outcome must remain owned by identifiable actors.

## Critical Finding: Constitutional Triggers Section

**Lines 285-314 of Product Brief must be entirely removed or fundamentally rewritten.**

This section is the most severe violation found. It:
- Claims "automatic, non-discretionary" rules
- States "Rules must be automatic, not discretionary"
- Asserts automatic freezing of petitions

Per Inversion #3 (Automaticity is impossible), this section **lies about what the system can do**.

**Recommended replacement concept:**
> **Forced Moments of Witness (Non-Negotiable)**
>
> These are not triggers—they are thresholds where the system forces itself to see what it might prefer to ignore.
>
> When these thresholds are crossed:
> - The cost of proceeding is made explicit
> - Continuation requires a public choice, not a quiet bypass
> - Evasion becomes expensive, not impossible
>
> The system does not prevent itself from crossing these lines. It only ensures that crossing them cannot happen silently.

## Execution Order Recommendation

1. **Product Brief Rewrite** (highest contamination, front-door truth)
2. **Architecture Rewrite** (shapes implementation)
3. **Mitigation Spec Rewrite** (operational implications)
4. **Epics Review** (full document scan needed)
5. **Amendment Notes Review** (lower priority)

## Verification Checklist

After Integration Pass, use these checks:

- [ ] No sentence claims protection, prevention, or guarantee
- [ ] No sentence claims binding force or inevitability
