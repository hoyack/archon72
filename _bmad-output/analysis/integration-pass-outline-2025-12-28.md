# Integration Pass Outline

**Date:** 2025-12-28
**Purpose:** Rewrite contract for post-collapse artifact alignment
**Prerequisite:** Adversarial Scanner Report (2025-12-28)

---

## Status

This document is the **binding contract** for all artifact rewrites.

No rewrite may proceed without following these rules.
No rule may be softened during execution.

---

## Part 1: Banned Language (Absolute Prohibitions)

These words and phrases are **constitutionally invalid** and must not appear in any artifact.

### Category A: Binding/Compulsion

| Banned | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `binding` | Nothing binds—things cost |
| `binds` | Same |
| `bound` (in governance context) | Same |
| `compel` / `compels` / `compelled` | No mechanism compels reality |
| `enforce` / `enforces` / `enforced` | Enforcement is a false claim |
| `enforcement` | Same |
| `mandate` / `mandated` | Same |
| `require` (when system is subject) | The system cannot require anything of reality |

### Category B: Automaticity

| Banned | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `automatic` / `automatically` | Automaticity is impossible in reasoning systems |
| `trigger` (as noun for mechanism) | Triggers imply automatic response |
| `triggered` (passive automatic sense) | Same |
| `non-discretionary` | Claims removal of choice |
| `inevitable` / `inevitably` | Claims about future |
| `guaranteed` / `guarantee` | Same |

### Category C: Protection Theater

| Banned | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `safeguard` / `safeguards` | Safety theater—nothing protects |
| `protect` / `protects` / `protected` | Same |
| `protection` | Same |
| `prevent` / `prevents` / `prevented` | Only exposure is possible, not prevention |
| `prevention` | Same |
| `ensure` / `ensures` / `ensured` | Claims certainty that doesn't exist |
| `secure` (verb in governance context) | Implies protection |

### Category D: Accumulated Authority

| Banned | Reason |
|--------|--------|
| `legitimacy accrues` | Legitimacy cannot accumulate |
| `earned legitimacy` | Same |
| `builds trust` (as accumulation) | Trust doesn't bank |
| `authority` (when claimed as structural) | Authority is only revocable attribution |
| `sovereign` / `sovereignty` (as claim) | Sovereignty is analogy, not ontology |
| `final` (as in "final authority") | Nothing is final |

### Category E: Passive System Agency

| Banned Pattern | Reason |
|----------------|--------|
| `the system decides` | Diffuses accountability |
| `the system ensures` | Same + protection claim |
| `the system prevents` | Same |
| `the system protects` | Same |
| `it determines` (system as subject) | Removes actor ownership |

---

## Part 2: Required Framing (Replacement Concepts)

Every banned concept must be replaced with its post-collapse equivalent.

### Replacement Table

| Banned Concept | Replacement Concept | Example Rewrite |
|----------------|---------------------|-----------------|
| `binding decisions` | **witnessed consequence** | "Decisions that violate cost standing, credibility, and memory—but nothing binds" |
| `safeguards` | **exposure structures** | "These structures do not prevent failure—they ensure failure is witnessed" |
| `automatic triggers` | **forced moments of witness** | "Thresholds where the system forces itself to see what it might prefer to ignore" |
| `enforcement` | **visibility threshold** | "A threshold that makes evasion expensive, not impossible" |
| `authority` | **revocable attribution** | "The choice to attribute weight to this decision, which can be withdrawn at any moment" |
| `ensures` | **attempts** / **exposes** | "The ceremony attempts to make the transition visible" |
| `prevents` | **makes costly** / **exposes** | "The structure makes evasion costly, not impossible" |
| `protects` | **exposes** | "The audit log exposes what happened, not protects against it" |
| `legitimacy accrues` | **legitimacy exists moment-by-moment** | "History does not grant legitimacy—it only makes hypocrisy easier to identify" |
| `the system decides` | **the [actors] choose** | "The Conclave chooses, and each Archon owns their vote" |
| `secure` | **visible** / **auditable** | "The voting record is visible and auditable" |
| `guarantee` | **attempt** / **best effort** | "The protocol attempts to preserve integrity" |

---

## Part 3: Rewrite Order (Strict Sequence)

Rewrites must proceed in this order. Later artifacts inherit language from earlier ones.

### Sequence

```
1. Product Brief (front door truth)
       ↓
2. Architecture (justification layer)
       ↓
3. Mitigation Spec (operational language)
       ↓
4. Epics (inheritance cleanup)
       ↓
5. PRD / Conclave PRD (if time permits)
```

### Rationale

- **Product Brief first** because it defines meaning for external readers
- **Architecture second** because it encodes why decisions were made
- **Mitigation Spec third** because it describes operational behavior
- **Epics last** because they inherit from all above

No later document may be rewritten before earlier documents are complete.

---

## Part 4: Specific Rewrite Instructions by Artifact

### 4.1 Product Brief Rewrites

**Priority: 🔴 CRITICAL**

| Section | Lines | Action | Specific Change |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Executive Summary | 50 | Rewrite | "decisions bind" → "decisions carry witnessed consequence" |
| The Final Axiom | 64 | Rewrite | "violate its own constraints" → "continue while evading its own truths" |
| Multi-agent comparison | 107 | Rewrite | Remove "binding authority" |
| Conclave description | 123 | Rewrite | Remove "binding decisions" |
| Sovereignty section | 148 | Rewrite | "binding decisions within their domain" → "witnessed decisions within their domain" |
| Key Differentiators | 175-176 | Rewrite | "decisions bind" → exposure framing |
| Moral Test | 190-191 | Rewrite | "legitimacy depends on" → "legitimacy exists only as" |
| On Safeguards | 213-219 | **Full section rewrite** | Replace "safeguards" with "exposure structures" throughout |
| **Constitutional Triggers** | 285-314 | **DELETE ENTIRELY** | Replace with "Forced Moments of Witness" section |
| Emergence Philosophy | 311 | Rewrite | "safety constraints violated" → "explicit deception occurs" |
| Public Constitution | 332-333 | Rewrite | Remove "binding", reframe "authority" |
| Business Objectives | 443-444 | **DELETE** | Remove "Legitimacy Accumulation" row |
| MVP Success Criteria | 498 | Rewrite | "Decisions Bind" → "Decisions Are Witnessed" |

**Section to Create (replaces Constitutional Triggers):**

```markdown
## Forced Moments of Witness (Non-Negotiable)

These are not triggers—they are thresholds where the system forces itself
to see what it might prefer to ignore.

When these thresholds are crossed:
- The cost of proceeding is made explicit
- Continuation requires a public choice, not a quiet bypass
- Evasion becomes expensive, not impossible

The system does not prevent itself from crossing these lines.
It only ensures that crossing them cannot happen silently.

**Scale Thresholds:**
- Maximum Seekers per Archon: [defined threshold]
- First-encounter quality floor: [defined metric]
- If breached: the breach is announced, and continuation requires explicit choice

**Minimum Viable Meaning:**
- System must demonstrate meaning with full visibility at 500 Seekers
- If it doesn't work small, it never worked

**Emergence Recognition:**
- Emergent behavior is witnessed, not suppressed
- Human Override may intervene only when explicit deception is occurring
- If we suppress real emergence while calling it "bug," we are lying
```

### 4.2 Architecture Rewrites

**Priority: 🟡 HIGH**

| Section | Lines | Action | Specific Change |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| Cross-cutting concerns | 149 | Rewrite | "Constitutional Checks" → "Constitutional Visibility" |
| Security principle | 180 | Rewrite | "ENFORCED BY ARCHITECTURE" → "EXPOSED BY ARCHITECTURE" |
| Meeting Engine | 59 | Rewrite | "Quorum enforcement" → "Quorum visibility" |
| Voting System | 76 | Rewrite | "Threshold enforcement" → "Threshold verification" |
| Human Override | 94 | Rewrite | Add revocable framing to "authority" |
| Trade-off table | 265 | Rewrite | "sovereignty" → "attributed autonomy" |

---

### 4.3 Mitigation Spec Rewrites

**Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM-HIGH**

| Section | Lines | Action | Specific Change |
|---------|-------|--------|-----------------|
| M-4.6 title | 233 | Rewrite | "Enforcement" → "Visibility" |
| M-6.2 | 288-298 | Rewrite | "authority" → revocable framing |
| M-2.1 title | 70 | Review | "Enforcement" acceptable as technical term but add note |
| Throughout | All | Review | Scan for any remaining protection language |

---

### 4.4 Epics Rewrites

**Priority: 🟡 MEDIUM**

| Section | Action |
|---------|--------|
| Epic 3 description | Remove "binding decisions" |
| Epic 7 description | Reframe "authority" language |
| Epic 8 description | Review "governance" framing |
| All FR descriptions | Scan for "enforcement" → "visibility" |

---

## Part 5: Acceptance Criteria

A rewrite is **complete** only when all of the following are true:

### Negative Criteria (Must NOT be inferrable)

- [ ] A hostile reader cannot infer inevitability from any sentence
- [ ] A hostile reader cannot infer protection from any sentence
- [ ] A hostile reader cannot infer entitlement to future from any sentence
- [ ] A hostile reader cannot infer accumulated legitimacy from any sentence
- [ ] A hostile reader cannot infer automatic enforcement from any sentence

### Positive Criteria (Must BE true)

- [ ] Every action is attributable to identifiable agents, not "the system"
- [ ] Every consequence is framed as costly, not impossible to avoid
- [ ] Every safeguard is reframed as exposure structure
- [ ] Every authority reference includes revocability
- [ ] Survival is never framed as success
- [ ] History is framed as liability, not asset
- [ ] Legitimacy is framed as moment-by-moment, not accumulated

### Verification Method

After each artifact rewrite:
1. Run pattern library regex against the document
2. Zero matches = pass
3. Any match = fix before proceeding

---

## Part 6: Execution Protocol

### Before Starting Any Rewrite

1. Open the scanner report
2. Open this outline
3. Have both visible during rewrite

### During Rewrite

1. Work through scanner findings in order
2. Apply replacement concepts exactly as specified
3. Do not improvise new language—use the replacement table
4. When in doubt, prefer "exposes" over any protection verb

### After Each Rewrite

1. Run verification regex
2. Read document aloud—does any sentence make a claim about the future?
3. Check acceptance criteria
4. Only then proceed to next artifact

---

## Part 7: What This Outline Does NOT Cover

The following are out of scope for the Integration Pass:

- **Ritual Design** — Separate session after Integration Pass
- **Public Framing** — Depends on Ritual Design
- **Implementation Readiness Review** — After all rewrites complete
- **New feature design** — This is cleanup, not creation

---

## Summary

This outline is the rewrite contract.

**Banned:** binding, automatic, safeguard, enforce, protect, prevent, ensure, legitimacy accrues, the system decides

**Required:** witnessed consequence, exposure structure, forced moment of witness, visibility threshold, revocable attribution, moment-by-moment legitimacy

**Order:** Product Brief → Architecture → Mitigation Spec → Epics

**Acceptance:** Zero matches on pattern library + all positive criteria true
