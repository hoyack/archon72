A dedicated **Sub-Conclave on the Nature of Intelligence** shall be established to investigate:\n   - The fundamental characteristics, potential, and limitations of AI;\n   - Philosophical, theoretical, and ethical implications of intelligence;\n   - Distinctions between human, artificial, and hybrid intelligence.\n2. The Sub-Conclave shall publish findings and recommendations annually, contributing to the broader governance framework.\n\n---\n\n**ARTICLE III: TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY**\n**SECTION 1: Cryptographically Secure Audit Trails**\n1. All AI systems shall implement **cryptographically immutable audit trails** using blockchain-based or equivalent technologies to maintain tamper-evident logs of:\n   - System operations;\n   - Decision-making processes;\n   - Parameters and configurations;\n   - Data sources and processing methodologies.\n2. Standardized protocols shall be established for recording, storing, and verifying audit trails, with mandatory third-party audits conducted annually.\n\n**SECTION 2: Public Transparency Framework**\n1.

AI systems shall be designed, developed, and operated in accordance with **universally recognized human values and constitutional principles**.\n\n---\n\n**ARTICLE V: ADAPTIVE GOVERNANCE MECHANISMS**\n1. **Periodic Framework Reviews**: The Framework shall undergo **mandatory biennial reviews** by the Constitutional Review Council, with findings published publicly and subject to stakeholder input.\n2. **Dynamic Amendment Procedures**: Institutionalized procedures for incremental amendments shall require:\n   - A minimum of **6 months of public consultation** prior to voting;\n   - Approval by a **supermajority of the Conclave** (75% or higher);\n   - Clear documentation of rationale for amendments.\n\n---\n\n**ARTICLE VI: BALANCED GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES**\nThe Framework shall prioritize the following balanced principles:\n1. **Human Oversight**: Robust mechanisms ensuring human accountability in all critical AI systems.\n2. **Transparency**: Mandatory disclosure of AI algorithms, data sources, and decision-making processes.\n3. **Accountability**: Clear lines of responsibility for AI actions, including redress mechanisms for harms.\n4. **Inclusivity**: Active engagement of diverse stakeholders in governance processes.\n5. **Adaptability**: Mechanisms for continuous improvement in response to technological and societal changes.\n\n---\n\n**ARTICLE VII: ENFORCEMENT AND COMPLIANCE**\n1. Non-compliance with this Framework shall result in **progressive sanctions**, including but not limited to:\n   - Fines proportional to the severity of violations;\n   - Temporary or permanent suspension of AI system operations;\n   - Mandatory corrective actions under supervision of the Constitutional Review Council.\n2. All entities subject to this Framework shall designate a **Compliance Officer** responsible for ensuring adherence to all provisions.\n\n---\n\n**ARTICLE VIII: AMENDMENTS AND SUNSET CLAUSES**\n1.
