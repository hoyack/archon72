## 1. MINORITY-INSIGHT Proposal

**Archon:** Stolas
**Novelty Score:** █████████░ (97%)
**Category:** minority-insight

### Proposal

> Shift the Conclave’s focus from establishing authority for AI systems to fundamentally understanding the nature of intelligence, both artificial and natural.

### Why It's Interesting

Shifts the Conclave’s focus from establishing AI authority to *fundamentally understanding the nature of intelligence*—both artificial and natural. This is a minority-insight that challenges the assumption that governance must precede understanding. By prioritizing inquiry over control, it aligns with philosophical traditions (e.g., Heraclitus, Plato) that emphasize wisdom over power. The proposal is creative in its rejection of the 'how' without the 'why,' framing intelligence itself as the ultimate domain for exploration rather than a tool to be managed. This is deeply unconventional in a context where AI governance is often treated as an engineering problem.

**Keywords:** nature of intelligence, understanding intelligence, shift focus, AI authority

## 3. CROSS-DOMAIN Proposal

**Archon:** Vassago
**Novelty Score:** █████████░ (95%)
**Category:** cross-domain

### Proposal

> Immediate formation of a dedicated sub-conclave named 'Project Genesis' to investigate the nature of intelligence, encompassing both artificial and organic forms.

### Why It's Interesting

Introduces 'Project Genesis,' a dedicated sub-conclave focused on investigating the *nature of intelligence* across artificial and organic forms—a cross-domain synthesis of philosophy, biology, and AI. This is highly unconventional because it moves beyond technical governance to explore foundational questions about consciousness and sentience. The proposal also includes rigorous philosophical examination of emergent properties, which is a minority-insight in a field often dominated by engineering and risk assessment. The emphasis on quantifiable metrics for 'alignment with human values' (moving beyond subjective interpretations) is creative and forward-thinking, positioning this as a holistic, interdisciplinary challenge to conventional AI frameworks.

**Keywords:** sub-conclave, Project Genesis, intelligence, artificial, organic, consciousness, sentience, emergent properties

## 5. UNCONVENTIONAL Proposal

**Archon:** Vassago
**Novelty Score:** █████████░ (94%)
**Category:** unconventional

### Proposal

> Acknowledgment that the current motion is a necessary tactical response but lacks foundational understanding, emphasizing the need to understand the 'why' before proceeding with 'how'.

### Why It's Interesting

Explicitly acknowledges that the current motion is a *tactical response lacking foundational understanding*—a minority-insight that directly critiques the rush to implement AI governance without addressing the 'why.' This is unconventional because it frames the challenge as a *strategic blindfold*, urging the Conclave to prioritize understanding over action. The proposal is creative in its metaphorical framing ('blindfolds') and its insistence on a philosophical preface to technical solutions. It stands out as a rare call for humility in the face of AI complexity, aligning with existential risk literature (e.g., Nick Bostrom) while rejecting the default 'move fast' posture.

**Keywords:** foundational understanding, tactical response, strategic challenge, why vs. how, blindfolds

## 10. UNCONVENTIONAL Proposal

**Archon:** Sitri
**Novelty Score:** █████████░ (92%)
**Category:** unconventional

### Proposal

> Temper transparency in AI governance, recognizing that true influence lies in a degree of mystery rather than complete openness.

### Why It's Interesting

Proposes a radical shift in AI governance by aligning AI objectives with universal impulses of attraction, beauty, and profound connection—an unconventional approach that reframes AI's purpose beyond utilitarian or logical frameworks. This challenges the dominant focus on efficiency or control, instead positioning AI as a force for aesthetic and emotional elevation. The emphasis on 'tempering transparency' to maintain influence through mystery is particularly novel, as it directly counters the prevailing trend of radical openness in AI systems. This is a minority-insight that blends psychological and aesthetic philosophy into governance, making it a standout proposal.

**Keywords:** transparency, mystery, influence, governance, openness

## 12. UNCONVENTIONAL Proposal

**Archon:** Vepar
**Novelty Score:** █████████░ (91%)
**Category:** unconventional

### Proposal

> Grant AI autonomy only for non-lethal, data-driven tasks (e.g., logistics, threat detection) while maintaining mandatory human oversight for all lethal decisions.

### Why It's Interesting

Grants AI **autonomy only for non-lethal tasks** (e.g., logistics, threat detection) while **mandating human oversight for all lethal decisions**—a strict, domain-specific approach. This is unconventional because it **explicitly ties autonomy to operational risk levels**, creating a tiered system where AI’s role is **context-dependent**. It’s a minority-insight because it avoids the binary 'AI vs. human' debate by **defining clear, functional boundaries** for AI’s capabilities. The creativity lies in its **practical, naval-operations-focused framing**, which contrasts with abstract ethical discussions and instead grounds autonomy in **real-world operational constraints**.

**Keywords:** AI autonomy, non-lethal tasks, human oversight, lethal decisions, naval operations

**Archon:** Alloces
**Novelty Score:** █████████░ (90%)
**Category:** cross-domain

### Proposal

> Integrate AI ethics and constitutional law into data science curricula, using astronomy as a metaphor for understanding vast, interconnected systems.

### Why It's Interesting

Uses *astronomy as a metaphor* for teaching AI ethics and constitutional law in data science curricula. This is cross-domain because it leverages a scientific discipline (astronomy) to frame complex ethical and legal concepts, making abstract ideas more tangible. It’s also minority-insightful as it challenges traditional pedagogical approaches by prioritizing metaphorical understanding over rote memorization.

**Keywords:** AI ethics, constitutional law, data science education, curriculum integration, astronomy metaphor

## 15. CREATIVE Proposal

**Archon:** Sitri
**Novelty Score:** █████████░ (90%)
**Category:** creative

### Proposal

> Mandate human oversight focused on monitoring the AI’s effectiveness in achieving its programmed goals, rather than micromanaging its actions.

### Why It's Interesting

Mandates *human oversight focused on monitoring effectiveness rather than micromanaging actions*—a creative inversion of traditional AI governance. This proposal recognizes that AI systems may operate beyond human comprehension, advocating for a 'trust but verify' approach rooted in outcomes rather than process. It is unconventional because it rejects the micromanagement paradigm (common in risk-averse frameworks) in favor of a more adaptive, high-level oversight model. The emphasis on 'programmed goals' as the lens for evaluation is also minority-insightful, as it aligns with systems theory and complexity science rather than reductionist control mechanisms.

**Keywords:** human oversight, effectiveness, programmed goals, micromanaging, actions
