   - Implement **quarterly adaptive risk assessments** to evaluate and adjust governance parameters in response to technological advancements and societal changes.

2. **Iterative Policy Refinement Process**:
   - Adopt a structured **iterative governance refinement process** to ensure policies remain effective and relevant:
     a) **Noise-Driven Collaboration**: Conduct periodic open debates and stakeholder consultations to gather diverse perspectives and identify governance gaps.
     b) **Evidence-Based Updates**: Utilize real-time data, incident reports, and technological advancements to inform policy refinements.
     c) **Automated Governance Feedback Loops**: Integrate AI-driven analytics to continuously monitor compliance and suggest policy adjustments.
     d) **Transparency in Refinement**: Publish governance updates, rationale, and impact assessments to ensure accountability and public trust.

3. **Implementation Mandates**:
   - All AI systems must comply with the dynamic governance framework, with oversight intensity directly proportional to their risk profile.
   - The Governance Council shall establish clear criteria for escalating oversight for high-risk AI deployments, including mandatory human-in-the-loop validation where necessary.
   - Annual audits shall verify the effectiveness of the dynamic framework, with findings publicly disclosed to foster transparency.

4. **Transition Provisions**:
   - Existing AI systems shall undergo a **risk-based compliance assessment** within 12 months of framework implementation.
   - The Governance Council shall develop a **phased rollout plan** for integrating the dynamic framework across all jurisdictions, prioritizing high-risk sectors.

### Rationale


This mega-motion consolidates the key provisions from both source motions to create a unified framework for dynamic AI governance. It eliminates redundancy by merging the risk-based oversight requirements with the iterative policy refinement process into a cohesive structure. The motion preserves critical nuances such as the real-time adaptability of oversight, the integration of stakeholder-driven 'noise' in policy-making, and the emphasis on evidence-based updates. The formal legislative language ensures clarity and enforceability, while the comprehensive yet concise structure maintains focus on the core objectives: creating a flexible, responsive governance system that evolves with technological and societal changes. The inclusion of accountability measures ensures compliance and continuous improvement.

      - One legal expert specializing in constitutional law;
      - One domain-specific subject matter expert;
      - One representative from the affected community (where applicable);
   b) **Real-time monitoring** during execution of high-stakes decisions through:
      - Continuous auditing of decision rationale;
      - Immediate suspension protocols for catastrophic outcomes;
      - Automated alert systems for deviation from approved parameters;

3. **TRIGGERING PROTOCOLS**:
   High-stakes decisions shall automatically trigger:
   a) Mandatory human-in-the-loop verification for critical parameters;
   b) Immediate reporting to the Governance Council within [Z] hours of initiation;
   c) Public disclosure requirements for decisions affecting:
      - Human rights;

7. **IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE**:
   All existing AI systems shall comply with these provisions within [N] months of adoption.
   New systems shall incorporate these requirements at the design phase.
   

### Rationale


This mega-motion consolidates the comprehensive framework for high-stakes AI decision-making by:
1. Establishing precise, legally binding definitions of what constitutes 'high-stakes' decisions across multiple domains;
2. Creating a multi-layered oversight system combining pre-decision review, real-time monitoring, and post-decision accountability;
3. Implementing progressive capability-based limitations that evolve with technological advancement;
4. Incorporating robust responsibility frameworks that address liability and compensation;
5. Establishing clear implementation timelines and evolutionary mechanisms for continuous improvement;
6. Maintaining balance between necessary oversight and operational flexibility;
7. Addressing both immediate concerns and long-term existential risks through adaptive governance structures;

The motion preserves all critical elements from the source while eliminating redundancy by:
