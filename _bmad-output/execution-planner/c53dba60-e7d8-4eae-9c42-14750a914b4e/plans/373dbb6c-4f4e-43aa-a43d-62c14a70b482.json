This framework shall supersede all existing Conclave directives related to AI risk management and governance.\n2. All existing AI systems shall undergo comprehensive risk assessment within 18 months of adoption.\n3. The Governance Council shall present an initial implementation plan within 90 days of adoption.\n4. Any modifications to this framework require approval by a 2/3 majority of the Conclave's technical advisory board.\n",
