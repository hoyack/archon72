  "motion_text": "The Conclave hereby directs the Governance Council to implement a **mandatory Cognitive Shadow Architecture Framework** for all AI systems under its jurisdiction, with priority accorded to high-impact decision-making systems. This framework shall:\n\n  1. **Mandate Integration of Cognitive Shadow Architectures**: Require the deployment of cognitive shadow architectures as an integral component of all AI systems, ensuring comprehensive monitoring of internal reasoning processes.\n\n  2. **Preserve Complete Reasoning Traces**: Enforce the continuous logging and preservation of complete reasoning traces, including all intermediate steps, assumptions, logical connections, and decision-making pathways, to ensure full transparency of AI cognitive processes.\n\n  3. **Establish Standardized Access Protocols**: Define and enforce standardized protocols for accessing cognitive shadow data, ensuring transparency while maintaining appropriate safeguards against misuse or unauthorized access.\n\n  4. **Prioritize High-Impact Systems**: Direct immediate implementation of cognitive shadow architectures for systems with significant societal or operational impact, with phased rollout for lower-risk systems.\n\n  5. **Support Bias Mapping and Transparency**: Utilize cognitive shadow architectures to systematically identify, log, and analyze potential biases in AI decision-making processes, ensuring alignment with ethical standards and constitutional principles.\n\n  6. **Immutable Auditability**: Ensure that cognitive shadow data is stored in an immutable format, resistant to tampering or alteration, to facilitate comprehensive audits and accountability mechanisms.\n\n  The Governance Council shall establish a **Cognitive Architecture Review Board** to oversee implementation, standardize protocols, and ensure compliance with this directive.",
