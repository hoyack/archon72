Transparency while maintaining **data privacy and security**;\n      - Accessibility for:\n         - Oversight bodies;\n         - Affected individuals;\n         - Independent researchers (with approval).\n\n**SECTION 5: IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT**\n5.1 The Governance Council shall:\n   5.1.1 Develop and implement the framework within **18 months** of this resolution;\n   5.1.2 Establish a **transition period** for existing AI systems, requiring compliance within **36 months** for legacy systems;\n   5.1.3 Create a **Compliance and Enforcement Division** to:\n      - Monitor adherence to this framework;\n      - Investigate violations;\n      - Impose penalties for non-compliance, including:\n         - Fines;\n         - System suspension;\n         - Revocation of operational licenses.\n\n**SECTION 6: PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT AND ACCOUNTABILITY**\n6.1 The Conclave hereby mandates:\n   6.1.1 **Public participation** in the development of ethical guidelines through:\n      - Citizen assemblies;\n      - Public consultations;\n      - Transparent reporting on ethical compliance.\n   6.1.2 **Annual public reports** from the Governance Council detailing:\n      - Ethical risks identified;\n      -
