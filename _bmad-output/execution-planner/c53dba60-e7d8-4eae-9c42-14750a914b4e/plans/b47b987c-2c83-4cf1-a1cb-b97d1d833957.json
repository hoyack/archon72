  "motion_text": "\nThe Conclace hereby directs the Governance Council to establish a **Comprehensive AI Governance Framework** that integrates continuous improvement and evaluation mechanisms to ensure AI systems operate within clearly defined boundaries of accountability, transparency, and alignment with human values. This framework shall include the following provisions:\n\n1. **Continuous Evaluation and Improvement Mechanisms**:\n   - **Mandate quarterly independent audits** of all AI systems, with comprehensive reports submitted to the Ethics Review Board and public disclosure of critical findings to ensure transparency and accountability.\n   - **Create a dynamic Improvement Task Force**, comprising AI researchers, ethicists, operational experts, and representatives from diverse stakeholder groups, to design and implement iterative evaluation protocols for emerging AI capabilities, including AGI and autonomous systems.\n   - **Implement real-time feedback mechanisms** requiring developers to integrate user feedback, ethical review, and performance data into iterative improvement cycles. These mechanisms shall include mandatory reporting of system behavior, decision-making logic, and alignment with constitutional principles.\n\n2. **Clear Accountability Structures**:\n   - Establish transparent lines of responsibility for AI development, deployment, and oversight, ensuring that human oversight remains paramount while allowing for appropriate levels of AI autonomy.\n   - Define roles and escalation pathways for oversight committees to review critical decisions, ethical violations, and misalignment risks, ensuring accountability at all stages of AI lifecycle.\n\n3. **Enhanced Transparency and Audit Protocols**:\n   - Implement **immutable, tamper-proof audit trails** for all AI systems, capturing decision-making logic, input/output data, human intervention records, and performance metrics. These audit trails shall be accessible in real-time to oversight bodies and subject to third-party verification.\n   - Require **third-party audits** conducted by independent entities to validate compliance with governance frameworks, ethical standards, and constitutional principles, with findings made publicly available.\n\n4. **Iterative Protocols for Emerging Capabilities**:\n   - Develop and enforce **dynamic evaluation protocols** tailored to emerging AI capabilities, including but not limited to AGI, autonomous systems, and high-risk applications. These protocols shall be regularly updated based on technological advancements and evolving ethical considerations.\n   - Mandate **proactive risk assessments** for new AI functionalities, requiring developers to demonstrate alignment with human values, safety standards, and constitutional principles prior to deployment.\n\n5. **Integration of Human Oversight**:\n   - Ensure that human oversight committees are permanently embedded within the governance framework, with the authority to intervene in AI decision-making processes, escalate ethical concerns, and enforce compliance with established guidelines.\n   - Require **mandatory human-in-the-loop validation** for critical AI decisions, ensuring that final accountability rests with human overseers while leveraging AI capabilities for support and analysis.\n\nThe Governance Council shall prioritize the implementation of these provisions, ensuring that all AI systems adhere to the highest standards of transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement.",
