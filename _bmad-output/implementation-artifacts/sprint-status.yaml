# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # Epic 10: CrewAI Integration & Archon Configuration (NEW)
  # ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
  # Added 2026-01-10 to track per-archon LLM configuration and CrewAI adapter work
  epic-10: in-progress

  # COMPLETED: Per-Archon Profile Configuration System
  10-1-archon-profile-configuration-system: done
  # Implemented 2026-01-10:
  # - LLMConfig domain model (src/domain/models/llm_config.py)
  # - ArchonProfile domain model (src/domain/models/archon_profile.py)
  # - ArchonProfileRepository port (src/application/ports/archon_profile_repository.py)
  # - CsvYamlArchonProfileAdapter (src/infrastructure/adapters/config/archon_profile_adapter.py)
  # - Per-archon LLM bindings config (config/archon-llm-bindings.yaml)
  # - 65 unit tests passing
  # - Spec: _bmad-output/planning-artifacts/archon-profile-system-spec.md
  # - Uses docs/archons-base.csv (72 Goetic archons with backstories, system prompts)

  # COMPLETED: CrewAI Adapter Implementation
  10-2-crewai-adapter-implementation: done
  # Implemented 2026-01-10:
  # - CrewAIAdapter implements AgentOrchestratorProtocol
  # - Uses ArchonProfile for per-archon LLM config (provider, model, temperature, timeout)
  # - System prompt from ArchonProfile.backstory injected (context-aware)
  # - Tools mapped from suggested_tools via tool_registry (placeholder for 10-3)
  # - 72 concurrent agents validated via asyncio.gather pattern
  # - 29 unit tests passing
  # Files created:
  #   - src/infrastructure/adapters/external/__init__.py
  #   - src/infrastructure/adapters/external/crewai_adapter.py
  #   - tests/unit/infrastructure/adapters/external/__init__.py
  #   - tests/unit/infrastructure/adapters/external/test_crewai_adapter.py

  # COMPLETED: Tool Registry for Archons
  10-3-tool-registry-for-archons: done
  # Story file: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/stories/10-3-tool-registry-for-archons.md
  # Implemented 2026-01-10:
  # - ToolRegistryProtocol port (src/application/ports/tool_registry.py)
  # - 9 stub tool implementations (src/infrastructure/adapters/tools/archon_tools.py)
  # - ToolRegistryAdapter (src/infrastructure/adapters/tools/tool_registry_adapter.py)
  # - CrewAIAdapter integration updated to use ToolRegistryProtocol
  # - 54 new unit tests + 29 existing tests passing

  # READY FOR DEV: Archon Selection Service
  10-4-archon-selection-service: ready-for-dev
  # Story file: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/stories/10-4-archon-selection-service.md
  # Description: Service to select relevant archons for a deliberation based on topic
  # Uses ArchonProfile.suggested_tools, domain, focus_areas, capabilities for matching

  # READY FOR DEV: End-to-End Deliberation Test
  10-5-end-to-end-deliberation-test: ready-for-dev
  # Story file: _bmad-output/implementation-artifacts/stories/10-5-end-to-end-deliberation-test.md
  # Description: Integration test with real LLM calls (requires API keys)
  # Validates full flow: topic → archon selection → LLM invocation → collective output
