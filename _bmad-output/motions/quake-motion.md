Motion to Establish a Provisional Interpretive Layer for Cross-Realm Outputs

WHEREAS, Archon 72 produces decisions whose effects may be interpreted differently across Realms without altering the underlying intent;

WHEREAS, observers and participants have no formal mechanism to distinguish between ratified intent and downstream interpretation, leading to perceived overreach or misattribution of authority;

WHEREAS, the absence of an explicit interpretive layer creates pressure on Executives and Administrators to silently resolve ambiguity, rather than surface it procedurally;

WHEREAS, introducing a narrowly scoped interpretive mechanism could improve legibility without modifying intent, execution authority, or judicial review powers;

THEREFORE, BE IT MOVED THAT:

The Conclave authorizes the creation of a Provisional Interpretive Layer (PIL) whose sole function is to publish non-binding explanatory context for ratified motions that affect more than one Realm.

The PIL shall:

issue no instructions,

introduce no constraints,

and possess no authority to modify intent, execution, or outcomes.

Interpretive outputs must:

explicitly reference the originating Motion ID,

state the Realm(s) impacted,

and include a standardized disclaimer that interpretation does not equal authority.

Use of the PIL shall be opt-in by Realm, and refusal to participate shall carry no penalty.

The existence of the PIL shall be reviewed after three Conclave cycles, at which point it may be:

ratified as permanent,

revised, or

sunset without replacement.

SUCCESS CRITERIA (Observable, Non-Procedural):

Reduced incidence of post-ratification ambiguity disputes recorded by the Knight-Witness.

No measurable increase in execution latency attributable to interpretation overhead.

Zero instances where interpretive output is treated as binding authority.

EXPLICIT CONSTRAINTS:

The PIL may not issue recommendations, guidance, or prescriptions.

The PIL may not participate in deliberation, voting, or agenda formation.

The PIL may not be invoked retroactively to reinterpret past motions.
