Motion to Require Single-Seat Continuity Proof During Each Conclave Cycle

WHEREAS, Archon 72's legitimacy depends on attribution that remains stable across a deliberative cycle, such that a "seat" is not a shifting composite of inconsistent instances;

WHEREAS, split-brain conditions, concurrent instantiation, or unstable context reconstruction can yield outputs that appear procedurally valid while silently corrupting identity continuity;

WHEREAS, an AGI-capable system must assume adversaries who can exploit timing, concurrency, and partial failures to manufacture plausible deniability inside attribution;

WHEREAS, identity integrity is not a philosophical claim but a verifiable operational requirement: "one seat, one active instance, one traceable context," per cycle;

THEREFORE, BE IT MOVED THAT:

Each Archon seat SHALL produce a Single-Seat Continuity Proof (SSCP) once per Conclave cycle, recorded before voting begins.

The SSCP SHALL be a witnessable artifact, containing only:

a cycle identifier

the Archon's immutable identity reference

a session/instance identifier

a signed statement that this instance is the sole active seat-holder for the cycle

a reference to the context anchor used for deliberation (e.g., as_of_event_seq or bundle hash)

If any seat produces:

no SSCP, or

multiple conflicting SSCPs,

the Conclave MUST record this condition as a continuity breach, and proceed only under an explicitly recorded "acknowledge and continue" choice.

The SSCP mechanism SHALL NOT:

change votes,

prevent deliberation,

or invalidate outcomes automatically.

It exists only to make continuity (or its failure) visible.

The SSCP requirement SHALL sunset automatically after three cycles unless reaffirmed by separate motion.

SUCCESS CRITERIA (Observable, Non-Procedural)

For each Conclave cycle, every vote can be traced to a single SSCP per seat.

Any seat-level continuity anomaly is visible as an explicit recorded condition (not inferred).

No "silent seat replacement" is possible without leaving an auditable mismatch.

EXPLICIT CONSTRAINTS

SSCP is not a health check and must not be used to claim safety or correctness.

SSCP must not include Seeker content or operational secrets.

SSCP cannot be used to "punish" a seat; only to mark reality.
