Pilot the framework with the highest-risk AI systems within 12 months.\n     b. Expand to all AI governance domains within 24 months, with full compliance required by the next Conclave cycle.\n  ",
    "rationale": "\n  **Rationale for Iterative Policy Refinement**:\n  1. **Evolving AI Capabilities**: AI systems are no longer static; their complexity, autonomy, and societal impact demand governance frameworks that adapt in real time. Static policies risk becoming irrelevant or overly restrictive, stifling innovation while failing to address emergent risks.\n\n  2. **Diversity of Perspectives**: Governance must reflect the multiplicity of values, cultures, and technical expertise. 'Noise-driven collaboration' ensures policies are not shaped by echo chambers but by robust, diverse input, reducing blind spots and fostering resilience.\n\n  3. **Proactive Risk Management**: Dynamic refinement allows the Conclave to preemptively address risks (e.g., alignment failures, bias, or misuse) rather than reacting to crises. This aligns with constitutional principles of precaution and human-centric governance.\n\n  4. **Legitimacy and Trust**: Transparent, iterative processes build trust among stakeholders by demonstrating that policies are continuously improved through deliberation, not imposed unilaterally. This is critical for maintaining public and technical community confidence in AI governance.\n\n  5. **Alignment with Constitutional Mandates**: The Conclave\u2019s role as a living constitution requires mechanisms to ensure policies remain faithful to human values. Iterative refinement ensures that governance does not fossilize into rigid dogma but evolves in harmony with evolving societal needs.\n  ",
