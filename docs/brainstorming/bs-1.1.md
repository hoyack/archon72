I'm genuinely torn between B and C, and here's why:
The case for C (Reverse Brainstorming):
We found the Discipline System gap by asking "how does X connect to Y?" But reverse brainstorming—"How could the Conclave catastrophically fail?"—uses a different lens. It stress-tests the system rather than the documentation. Failure modes often reveal which missing pieces are load-bearing vs. nice-to-have.
For example, I can already feel some failure scenarios itching to surface:

What if all 72 Archons deadlock 36-36 on a critical vote repeatedly?
What if a Guide goes "rogue" and starts telling Seekers what the Conclave discussed?
What if the High Archon election produces a winner that 60% of Archons actively opposed?
What if meeting duration spirals to 12+ hours and agents start degrading?

The case for B (Another category):
We've only scratched one category. There might be equally large gaps hiding in:

Challenge ↔ Credibility (who verifies completion? appeals?)
Guide ↔ Archon relationship (delegation, oversight, inheritance)
Patronage ↔ Governance (do Founders get more influence? Should they?)
Time ↔ Ceremony (what happens if a ceremony gets interrupted mid-ritual?)


My instinct: Let's do one more Question Storming category (B), then move to Reverse Brainstorming (C) with a fuller map of the gaps.
What categories do you have ready? I'm especially curious if there's one about Guide autonomy or Patronage ↔ Power — those feel like they might have philosophical landmines buried in them.
