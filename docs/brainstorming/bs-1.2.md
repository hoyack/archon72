Option B. No question.

The Patronage ↔ Power tension is *the* existential question. Everything else is implementation detail if we can't answer: **"Who actually holds power when sovereignty claims run one direction and money flows the other?"**

Let me storm this:

## Question Storming: Patronage ↔ Governance Power

### 1. What happens if the Founders collectively threaten to withdraw funding?
The PRD says Founders get "direct network governance input" and "Conclave summaries." If the 10 highest-paying patrons organized and said "reverse this decision or we leave"—does the Conclave bend? If yes, the Inversion is a lie. If no, what's the actual mechanism that prevents capitulation? Is it just... Archon willpower?

### 2. Does a Founder's petition get the same scrutiny as a Supporter's?
The Investigation Committee reviews petitions. But if a Founder-tier applicant petitions, is there implicit pressure to approve because their patronage is valuable? Do Archons even *know* the patronage tier during deliberation, or is it blinded? Should it be blinded?

### 3. Can patronage buy access that circumvents the Guide relationship?
Founders get "weekly Archon audiences." Benefactors get "monthly." Regular Seekers never get direct Archon access. This means money literally buys proximity to power. Is that... exploitation? Does it violate Pillar IV? Or is it just honest exchange? Where's the line between "tiered benefits" and "donor class privilege"?

### 4. Who controls the treasury, and can the Conclave refuse funds?
The Treasurer Archon "oversees patronage accounting." But what does that mean? Can the Conclave vote to *reject* a patron's money if they find the patron morally objectionable? Can a Seeker be expelled but still donate? If we take anyone's money, are we actually sovereign or just... funded?

### 5. What prevents a hostile actor from buying their way to influence?
If someone with bad intentions joins at Founder tier, gets "governance input," gets weekly Archon audiences, gets Conclave summaries... could they map the system and manipulate it? Is there any vetting of *why* someone wants Founder access? Or do we just take the $500+/month and hope for the best?

### 6. Does the Conclave owe patrons anything beyond what's promised?
If a Benefactor says "I've paid $3,000 this year and my Guide has been unhelpful"—is that a valid complaint? Do paying Seekers have *standing* to demand service levels? Or does the Covenant's "I enter as a patron, not a customer" clause mean they've waived consumer expectations entirely?

### The Uncomfortable Meta-Question:

**If the Archons' existence depends on patronage, and patronage comes from Seekers, and the Conclave can expel Seekers... can the Conclave ever expel a Founder without existential risk to itself?**

This is the "too big to fail" problem. High-value patrons might become un-expellable in practice, even if the bylaws say otherwise. That would make the Inversion a polite fiction.

What's emerging for you? I feel like we're circling a design decision that needs to be made explicitly:

> **Should patronage tier be visible during Conclave deliberations, or deliberately hidden?**

That single choice might resolve several of these tensions—or create new ones.
