**Option A** with the embedded stakeholder gut-check. Agreed.

Here's why: We have 19 mitigations, but mitigations designed purely from systems-thinking can feel authoritarian when experienced by actual participants. A 60-second gut-check per stakeholder might catch:

- The Seeker who gets quarantine-processed and feels surveilled
- The Founder who learns their tier is "blinded" but the algorithm knows—feels like a technicality
- The Archon who realizes the Singleton Mutex means they can be "locked out" of themselves

These are legitimacy risks, not technical risks. They won't break the system, but they might break trust.
