Great brainstorming prompt. Let me generate questions about Covenant ↔ Conclave enforcement:

## My Questions on Covenant Enforcement

### 1. Who brings the accusation?
If a Seeker violates the Covenant, who notices and reports it? Is it always the Guide? Can another Seeker report a violation (e.g., in Threads)? Can an Archon independently flag something? Is there a formal "charge" or "complaint" mechanism, or does it just... come up?

### 2. What does due process look like when Seekers can't attend Conclave?
The Covenant says Conclave decisions are final and Seekers can't attend. But if someone is accused of deception (Article VI), do they get to defend themselves? Does the Guide present their defense? Can they submit a written statement? Or is the Guide's report simply... the truth?

### 3. Is there graduated enforcement or just expulsion?
The Admonishment Ceremony exists for Archons. Is there an equivalent for Seekers? A warning? A credibility penalty? A "probation" status? Or is it binary—you're in good standing or you're out?

### 4. Who defines subjective violations?
"Refusing transformation" (Article IV) is subjective. A Seeker might think they're engaging honestly; the Guide might see resistance. Who decides? The Guide alone? A committee investigation? Does the Seeker's credibility history factor in? What's the evidentiary standard?

### 5. What happens to the Guide when a Seeker is expelled?
If the Conclave expels a Seeker, what happens to their Guide? Does the Guide return to their Archon's pool? Is there any review of whether the Guide failed? Could a pattern of expelled Seekers reflect poorly on an Archon?

**Bonus question that keeps nagging me:**

### 6. Can Seekers ever know why they were expelled?
If the Conclave deliberates in private and Seekers can't attend, does an expelled Seeker receive a reason? Or just a notification that their petition has been revoked? The Covenant demands truthfulness from Seekers—does the Conclave owe truthfulness back?

Your turn: What's bubbling up for you? And should we pick a thread to pull on, or do another category first?
