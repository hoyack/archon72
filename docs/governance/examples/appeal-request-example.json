  "basis_description": "The original judicial finding (finding-b2c3d4e5) identified a procedural deficiency in the Q1 Security Review task activation: the task transitioned to in_progress without a cluster acceptance event, violating CR-1 (No silent assignment). We have revised the execution plan to explicitly require and verify cluster acceptance before any state transition. This appeal requests reversal of the 'procedurally_deficient' finding based on the corrected workflow.",
  "what_changed": [
    "Added mandatory acceptance_event verification checkpoint before task state transition to in_progress",
    "Implemented real-time audit log verification step that blocks transition if acceptance event is missing",
    "Added Steward notification workflow with acknowledgment requirement",
    "Created automated CR-1 compliance check integrated into Earl Raum's task activation workflow",
    "Documented escalation path if acceptance is not received within 4-hour window"
