The evidence shows that Cluster 17 was actively working on the task and the Steward was aware of the assignment (per Slack channel records, though not formal acceptance). The gap appears to be a logging failure rather than a consent bypass. A finding of 'legitimate_with_concerns' with a recommendation for improved audit logging would better serve the system's interests without creating unnecessary friction. The majority's insistence on strict procedural compliance, while technically correct, risks prioritizing form over substance in cases where human consent was clearly present but improperly recorded."
