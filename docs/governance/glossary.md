| **Motion Seed** | A pre-admission submission of intent used to populate Queue 1 (New Motions) in the agenda system. Motion Seeds originate from Dukes/Earls (via Duke sponsorship) and must be sponsored by the appropriate King(s) before they become a valid Motion; the admission gate then validates the motion record. See [The Legislative Branch](./legislative-branch.md) for sponsorship rules and [Conclave Agenda Control](./conclave-agenda.md) for queue handling. |
| **Motion** | A formal Legislative Branch declaration of intent that states **WHAT** the system proposes to do (never HOW). A Motion must include a realm assignment with a **primary King sponsor**, and for cross-realm scope it requires **co-sponsors from every affected Realm**, matching the Motion schema’s sponsorship rules. See [The Legislative Branch](./legislative-branch.md) for content requirements and [Conclave Agenda Control](./conclave-agenda.md) for admission gate validation. |
