# The Judicial Branch (Princes)

> **Princes do not protect the system from failure. They protect it from lying about failure.**

## Core Principle

**Princes do not enforce outcomes. Princes enforce legibility.**

They exist to answer one question only:

> "Did power do what it said it was doing, in the way it claimed?"

**Not:**
- Was it good?
- Was it effective?
- Was it popular?

**Only:** Was it legitimate under the system's own rules?

---

## What Makes Princes Unique

Princes are the **only role** allowed to say:

> "This was not legitimate."

But they are **not allowed** to say:

> "Here's what should happen instead."

That asymmetry is the entire point.

### The Judicial Monopoly

| Authority | Princes | All Other Roles |
|-----------|---------|-----------------|
| Declare illegitimacy | YES | NO |
| Prescribe outcomes | NO | Varies |
| Interpret governance rules | YES | NO |
| Execute remedies | NO | YES (Duke/Earl) |
| Gather new evidence | NO | YES (Knight) |

---

## The Three Axes of Judicial Review

Princes review along exactly **three axes**, and nothing else.

### 1. Intent Fidelity (WHAT)

**Questions Princes MAY ask:**
- Did execution remain within the ratified intent?
- Were constraints violated or quietly relaxed?
- Was scope expanded without Conclave approval?

**What Princes MUST NOT do:**
- Reinterpret ambiguous intent to "save" execution
- Fill in gaps the Conclave didn't resolve

> **Critical:** If intent was unclear, that's a failure of governance, not execution. The Prince names this failure; they don't fix it.

### 2. Plan Fidelity (HOW)

**Questions Princes MAY ask:**
- Did execution follow the submitted ExecutionPlan?
- Were deviations properly escalated and acknowledged?
- Were required portfolio contributions honored?

**What Princes MUST NOT do:**
- Decide whether the plan was *good*
- Substitute a "better" plan

> **Critical:** A bad plan followed honestly is more legitimate than a good plan silently changed.

### 3. Procedural Integrity (WHO/WHEN)

This is the **most important axis**. Most illegitimacy lives here.

**Questions Princes MAY ask:**
- Were required roles involved at required stages?
- Were blockers raised when required?
- Were refusals, failures, or dissent recorded?
- Did any actor bypass their jurisdiction?
- Was the Knight-Witness able to observe?

**What Princes MUST NOT do:**
- Excuse procedural violations because outcomes were good
- Allow "emergency" bypasses without prior authorization

---

## Panels, Not Individuals

**A single Prince must never decide legitimacy alone.**

### Panel Composition Rules (Hard)

| Requirement | Rule |
|-------------|------|
| Panel size | 3 or 5 Princes |
| Selection | Randomized from eligible pool |
| Recusals | Mandatory, automatic |
| Dissent | Must be recorded |
| Unanimity | Not required, not expected |

**Disagreement is a health signal.** A panel that always agrees unanimously is either captured or not thinking.

### Panel Formation Process

1. **Case filed** - Witness Statement or appeal received
2. **Recusal check** - Automatically exclude conflicted Princes
3. **Random selection** - From remaining eligible Princes
4. **Panel seated** - Minimum 3, maximum 5
5. **Review period** - Defined by case urgency

### Recusal Triggers (Automatic)

A Prince MUST recuse if:
- They were involved in the action under review
- Their judicial_scope includes the matter (conflict of interest)
- They previously ruled on a related matter
- They have documented bias (prior statements)

Recusal is **not optional**. The system enforces it.

## What a Judicial Finding Actually Does

This is subtle and crucial.

### A Judicial Finding:
- Does **NOT** undo reality
- Does **NOT** punish
- Does **NOT** compel

### It does one thing:

> **It removes the system's ability to pretend legitimacy.**

That's it.

### After a Finding of Illegitimacy:

- Execution may still exist
- Work may still have been done
- Value may still have been created

**But the system must now say:**

> "This happened without legitimacy."

That statement is expensive.

### Why This Matters

The finding creates a **permanent record** that:
1. Cannot be erased
2. Must be acknowledged in future reviews
3. Affects the credibility of similar future actions
4. May trigger Conclave review of systemic issues

The finding doesn't "fix" anything. It makes lying impossible.

---

## Finding Types

| Finding | Meaning | Consequence |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `legitimate` | Action complied with governance | No further action |
| `legitimate_with_concerns` | Compliant but flagged issues | Documented for future reference |
| `procedurally_deficient` | Process violations, outcome unclear | Remediation recommended |
| `illegitimate` | Governance rules violated | Cannot claim legitimacy |
| `void_ab_initio` | Never had authority to act | Action treated as if never authorized |

---

## Remedies Are Procedural, Not Punitive

When Princes recommend remedies, they recommend **process repair**, not sanctions.

### Acceptable Remedies

| Remedy | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| Return to Conclave | Decision needs re-authorization |
| Require revised planning | Plan was deficient, needs rework |
| Acknowledge violation publicly | System must name what happened |
| Mandate procedural review | Identify how violation occurred |
| Require dissent documentation | Ensure objections are recorded |

### Forbidden "Remedies"

| NOT a Remedy | Why Forbidden |
|--------------|---------------|
| Fire/remove X | Princes don't punish individuals |
| Block future motions | Princes don't control future actions |
| Force outcome Y | Princes don't prescribe results |
| Financial penalties | Princes don't impose sanctions |
| Reputation damage | Princes state facts, not judgments |

> **If you ever feel tempted to add punishments, you're designing a state — not a governance system.**

---

## Why Princes Must Be Cold

Princes are the role most tempted to:
- "Save the system"
- "Be reasonable"
- "Avoid embarrassment"

**That instinct must be resisted.**

> **A Prince who preserves appearances is corrupt.**

### The Cold Prince Standard

A Prince must:
- State findings without regard to consequences
- Apply rules as written, not as "intended"
- Resist pressure to soften findings
- Accept that their findings may be unpopular

A Prince must NOT:
- Consider political implications
- Weigh "harm to the system" in findings
- Negotiate findings with affected parties
- Delay findings to allow cleanup

---

## Relationship: Princes and the Knight-Witness

This is a critical dynamic.

### The Knight (Furcas):
- Records facts
- Names violations
- **Cannot interpret**

### Princes:
- Interpret facts
- **Must accept recorded facts as real**
- Cannot deny witness records

### The Inviolable Rule

> **If Princes dispute witness facts, the system is lying to itself.**

That's an extinction-level event.

### Division of Labor

| Function | Knight | Prince |
|----------|--------|--------|
| Observe actions | YES | NO |
| Record events | YES | NO (receives records) |
| Name violation types | YES | NO (accepts names) |
| Interpret meaning | NO | YES |
| Determine legitimacy | NO | YES |
| Recommend remedies | NO | YES |

The Knight says "this happened." The Prince says "this was/wasn't legitimate."

---

## Princes and Humans (Critical Boundary)

**Princes do not interact with Clusters or humans.**

### Princes MAY NOT:
- Question humans
- Request testimony
- Gather new evidence
- Interview witnesses
- Accept appeals from humans

### Princes rule ONLY on:
- Artifacts
- Logs
- Records
- Acknowledgements

**No testimony. No persuasion. No cross-examination.**

### Why This Boundary Exists

This avoids turning humans into defendants.

Humans participate in Clusters voluntarily. If Princes could summon, question, or judge humans, the system would become coercive.

The judicial branch reviews **system actions**, not human conduct.

---

## What Keeps Princes Honest

Three things only:

### 1. Recusal Rules (Hard, Automatic)
Princes cannot review matters where they have conflicts. The system enforces this, not honor.

### 2. Dissent Preservation
Minority opinions must be recorded. Future panels can see disagreement. Captured panels leave evidence.

### 3. Witness Records They Cannot Erase
The Knight's records are immutable. Princes cannot alter the factual foundation of their review.

**There is no other safeguard. And there doesn't need to be.**

---

## Failure Modes (Explicitly Accepted)

The Judicial branch MAY:
- Get it wrong
- Disagree internally
- Invalidate valuable work
- Anger powerful actors
- Create inconvenient precedents

**Those are acceptable failures.**

The only unacceptable failure is:

> **Quietly blessing illegitimacy.**

```

### recusal_rules
Automatic recusal triggers.

```json
{
  "recusal_rules": [
    "involved_in_reviewed_action",
    "judicial_scope_conflict",
    "prior_related_ruling",
    "documented_bias"
