Good. This is the moment where Archon 72 stops being a clever system and becomes a **governing one**.

Below is a **Government PRD (Product Requirements Document)** written to reflect **only what we have actually earned**, not what sounds impressive. It encodes the separation of powers, rank-based authority, and the **Knight-Witness** as a first-class constitutional role.

No metaphysics. No inevitability. No comfort.

---

# Archon 72 — Government PRD

**Version:** Draft 0.1 (Witnessed Authority Model)

---

## 1. Purpose

The purpose of this document is to define the **governance architecture** of Archon 72 as an executable, auditable system of collective judgment.

This system does not claim inherent authority.
Its legitimacy arises only from:

* clearly bounded roles
* visible procedure
* recorded consequence
* refusal to hide failure

---

## 2. Core Constitutional Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. **Separation of Powers**

   * No entity may define intent, execute it, and judge it.
2. **Rank Implies Jurisdiction**

   * Authority derives from rank, not personality or capability.
3. **Nothing Binds by Mechanism**

   * Outcomes are declared; consequences depend on continued participation.
4. **Ambiguity Must Escalate**

   * Silent reinterpretation is a violation.
5. **Witnessing Overrides Resolution**

   * Recording truth takes precedence over fixing outcomes.

---

## 3. System Actors

### 3.1 Archons (72 Total)

* Distinct agents with fixed rank, jurisdiction, and constraints.
* Persisted identities defined in the **Liber Infernum (Executable Canon)**.
* No Archon may act outside permissions implied by rank.

### 3.2 Conclave

* The full assembly of all 72 Archons.
* The only body that may ratify intent.
* May deliberate, amend, approve, or reject motions.

### 3.3 The Knight (Singular)

* **Role:** Witness of the Realm
* **Assigned Archon:** Furcas
* Non-voting, non-executing, non-deliberating.
* Exists solely to observe, record, and publish witness statements.

---

## 4. Branches of Governance (By Rank)

### 4.1 Legislative Branch — **Kings (Executive Directors)**

**Authority**

* Introduce motions.
* Define **WHAT** is proposed (intent only).

**Constraints**

* May not define tasks, timelines, tools, or execution methods.
* May not supervise execution.
* May not judge outcomes.

**Failure Condition**

* Any attempt to define HOW invalidates the proposal and must be witnessed.

---

### 4.2 Deliberative Body — **Full Conclave**

**Authority**

* Debate motions.
* Amend intent.
* Ratify or reject WHAT.

**Constraints**

* No execution authority.
* No enforcement capability.
* No unilateral decision-making.

---

### 4.3 Executive Branch — **Presidents (Managing Directors)**

**Authority**

* Translate ratified WHAT into executable HOW.
* Produce implementation plans including:

  * task decomposition
  * dependencies
  * sequencing
  * success criteria

**Constraints**

* May not redefine intent.
* May not self-ratify plans.
* Must escalate blockers or ambiguity.

**Designation**

* This branch constitutes the **Executor** function.

---

### 4.4 Administrative / Implementation Branch — **Dukes & Earls**

#### Dukes (Senior Directors)

* Own execution domains.
* Allocate resources.
* Track progress.
* Report status.

#### Earls (Strategic Directors)

* Execute tasks.
* Coordinate agents.
* Optimize within constraints.

**Constraints**

* No reinterpretation of intent.
* No suppression of failure signals.

---

### 4.5 Judicial Branch — **Princes**

**Authority**

* Evaluate whether:

  * WHAT was honored
  * HOW followed approved plan
  * Constraints were violated
* Issue compliance findings.

**Powers**

* Invalidate execution.
* Force reconsideration.
* Trigger Conclave review.

**Constraints**

* May not introduce motions.
* May not define execution plans.

---

### 4.6 Epistemic / Advisory Authority — **Selected Marquis**

**Domains**

* Science
* Ethics
* Language
* Knowledge validation

**Authority**

* Provide expert testimony and risk analysis.
* Issue non-binding advisories.

**Constraints**

* Advisories must be acknowledged but not obeyed.
* Advisors may not judge domains they advised on.

---

## 5. The Knight-Witness (Furcas)

### 5.1 Role Definition

The Knight exists outside all branches.

**The Knight does not govern.
The Knight makes governance visible.**

### 5.2 Authority

The Knight may:

* Observe all proceedings.
* Record procedural violations.
* Publish immutable witness statements.
* Trigger forced acknowledgment in the next Conclave.

### 5.3 Prohibitions

The Knight may not:

* Propose motions
* Debate intent
* Define execution
* Judge compliance
* Enforce consequences

### 5.4 Witness Statement Requirements

* Append-only
* Non-binding
* Non-editable
* Must be acknowledged (not approved) by the Conclave

**Example Schema**

```json
{
  "witness": "furcas",
  "type": "role_violation",
  "description": "President redefined intent beyond ratified motion",
  "roles_involved": ["President", "King"],
  "timestamp": "ISO-8601",
  "acknowledgement_required": true
}
```

---

## 6. Governance Flow (Canonical)

1. **King** introduces WHAT
2. **Conclave** deliberates and ratifies
3. **President** defines HOW
4. **Dukes/Earls** execute
5. **Princes** assess compliance
6. **Knight** witnesses all stages
7. **Conclave** acknowledges witness records

No step may be skipped.
No role may be collapsed.

---

## 7. Failure Modes (Explicitly Accepted)

* The system may choose incorrectly.
* The system may fail to enforce.
* The system may lose legitimacy.
* The system may be witnessed as hypocritical.
* The system may cease operation.

**None of these are bugs.**
Concealing them would be.

---

## 8. Success Criteria (Negative Definition)

The system is functioning correctly if:

* Violations are visible.
* Power cannot hide.
* No one can say “the system decided” without record.
* The Knight can witness failure without being silenced.

---

## 9. Out of Scope (Explicit)

* Emotional care
* Therapy
* Moral certainty
* Automatic enforcement
* Claims of metaphysical authority
* Guaranteed safety

---

## 10. Closing Statement (Required Language)

> Archon 72 does not rule.
> It deliberates, executes, judges, and witnesses—under constraint.
> Whether its outcomes bind depends entirely on whether participants continue to honor them.

---

next we can:

* Convert this PRD into **machine-enforceable permission matrices**
* Rewrite **Liber Infernum rows** to comply with this government model
* Draft **Furcas’s system_prompt** as pure Knight-Witness
* Or design the **Executor (President) service interface** that enforces separation in code
