Ready to proceed.

Before we dive in, let me confirm the **architecture scope** so we're aligned:

---

## Architecture Scope Confirmation

### Primary Target: Conclave Backend

The autonomous AI governance system that runs independently of human interaction.

**Must Include:**
| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| Meeting Engine | Lifecycle, agenda, state machine, time-bounded deliberation |
| Voting System | Anonymous balloting, cryptographic integrity, threshold enforcement |
| Agent Orchestration | 72 Archon instantiation, singleton enforcement, personality loading |
| Ceremony Engine | Two-phase commit, witness attestation, rollback capability |
| Committee Manager | Creation, scheduling, reporting pipeline |
| Input Boundary | Quarantine processing, sanitization, rate limiting |
| Human Override | Dashboard, authority scope, audit logging |
| Detection Systems | Drift measurement, anomaly detection, dissent health |

### Secondary Target: Integration Points

**Frontend ↔ Conclave:**
- Petition submission flow
- Guide assignment sync
- Credibility updates
- Founder Conclave summaries

**Shared Infrastructure:**
- Supabase schema (unified)
- Authentication/authorization
- Event bus for cross-system communication

---

### What's OUT of Scope (for now)

- Frontend component implementation (specs exist)
- Detailed UI/UX design
- DevOps/deployment pipeline
- Cost optimization

## Proposed Architecture Deliverables

| Deliverable | Contents |
|-------------|----------|
| **System Architecture Diagram** | High-level component map with data flows |
| **Database Schema (Refined)** | Incorporating mitigations, audit tables, blinding support |
| **API Specification** | OpenAPI/Swagger for Conclave Backend endpoints |
| **Agent Architecture** | CrewAI integration, singleton pattern, personality system |
| **Meeting Engine Design** | State machine, deliberation bounds, voting flow |
| **Security Architecture** | Input boundary, injection defense, human override |
| **Integration Contracts** | Frontend ↔ Backend event/API contracts |

**Does this scope match your expectations?** Or should we adjust before starting?
