**Option 3: AI Governance Systems**

Here's my reasoning:

**Why not the others (for now):**

| Option | Why Defer |
|--------|-----------|
| Prompt Injection | Known problem, known partial solutions. We can research this when we hit implementation. |
| Multi-Agent Identity | CrewAI/LangChain docs + distributed systems literature. More "engineering lookup" than "research." |
| State Machines | Two-phase commit is well-studied. We can apply known patterns. |
| Patronage Tiering | Patreon, membership platforms, etc. exist. Can study their models directly. |

**Why AI Governance is the right research target:**

1. **It's the novel core.** The Conclave—AI entities that deliberate, vote, and self-govern—is what makes Archon 72 different from "chatbot with personality." If this has been done before, we need to learn from it. If it hasn't, we need to know we're pioneering.

2. **The brainstorming revealed governance as load-bearing.** Of our 15 Critical failures, at least 8 were governance failures (A1, A5, B4, C1, C2, C5, C5a, C7). Our mitigations are educated guesses. Are there precedents?

3. **Philosophical grounding matters.** We're blending Freemasonic governance, parliamentary procedure, and AI agency. Has anyone written seriously about AI parliamentary systems? AI voting theory? AI constitutional design?

4. **Failure here is existential.** Bad prompt injection defense = compromised Archon. Bad governance design = the entire system lacks legitimacy. The latter is harder to recover from.

**Specific Research Questions:**

1. **Precedents:** Have any AI systems implemented autonomous collective decision-making? DAOs with AI agents? AI-run organizations? Multi-agent voting systems?

2. **Theory:** Is there academic work on AI governance structures? AI constitutionalism? Machine ethics applied to collective AI behavior?

3. **Parliamentary AI:** Has anyone implemented Roberts Rules or parliamentary procedure in AI systems? Deliberation protocols for multi-agent systems?

4. **Failure cases:** Have any autonomous AI governance experiments failed? How? What can we learn?

5. **Hybrid models:** How have human-AI governance hybrids worked? (e.g., AI advisors to human boards, AI voting members, etc.)
