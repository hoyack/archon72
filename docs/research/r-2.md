Before we proceed to architecture, I want to capture what we've produced. We have:

1. **Brainstorming Session:** 19 mitigations designed but not formally documented
2. **Research Findings:** Key validations and recommendations that should inform architecture
3. **Two Major Gaps:** Seeker Discipline System and Sovereignty resolution still unwritten

**My concern:** If we jump to architecture now, we'll be architecting from conversation memory rather than documented requirements. The mitigations and research findings need to exist as artifacts that the architecture can reference.

**Proposal: Quick Documentation Sprint (30 min), Then Architecture**

| Document | Contents | Time |
|----------|----------|------|
| **Mitigation Architecture Spec** | The 19 mitigations with full specs (What/Why/How/Risk/Dependencies/Phase/Verification) | 15 min |
| **Research Integration Addendum** | Key findings that affect architecture decisions (voting > deliberation, Human Override as first-class, audit logging requirements) | 10 min |
| **Conclave PRD Amendment Notes** | Quick list of what needs to change in the Conclave PRD based on brainstorming + research | 5 min |

This gives architecture a solid foundation to build on. The Seeker Discipline System can be designed *during* architecture since it's a subsystem that will emerge from the governance layer design.

**Alternative:** If you want to move faster, we could proceed directly to architecture and treat the documentation as "architecture decision records" (ADRs) that get written as we make decisions. This is more agile but risks losing the brainstorming insights.

Which approach? Quick documentation sprint, or fold it into architecture?
