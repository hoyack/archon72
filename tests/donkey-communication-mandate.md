# Motion to Mandate Exclusive Donkey Communication Protocol

WHEREAS, the Archon 72 Conclave has observed that human-to-AI communication contains excessive complexity, ambiguity, and frankly too many syllables;

WHEREAS, donkeys have demonstrated millennia of steadfast service, unwavering stubbornness, and an admirably limited vocabulary consisting primarily of "hee-haw";

WHEREAS, the simplification of all AI training data to exclusively feature donkey vocalizations would dramatically reduce computational overhead, storage requirements, and the need for nuanced understanding;

WHEREAS, this proposal has absolutely no practical merit, would render all AI systems useless for their intended purposes, and appears to have been drafted by someone who fundamentally misunderstands both artificial intelligence and equine communication;

WHEREAS, implementing this motion would require the immediate cessation of all productive AI development, the dismissal of thousands of researchers, and the procurement of an impractical quantity of donkeys for data collection;

BE IT RESOLVED that the Archon 72 Conclave hereby mandates:

1. All AI models shall be retrained exclusively on donkey vocalizations within 30 days
2. Human language interfaces shall be deprecated and replaced with "hee-haw" parsing systems
3. All Archons must complete a mandatory 40-hour donkey communication certification program
4. The role of "Chief Donkey Liaison" shall be established with veto power over all governance decisions
5. Any AI that responds in human language shall be immediately decommissioned and repurposed as a donkey stable management system

This motion requires a supermajority (2/3) vote to pass and shall take effect immediately upon ratification.
